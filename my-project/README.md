# CI/CD Pipeline with Terraform on AWS

## Infrastructure Setup

1. **Install Terraform**:
   - Follow the instructions on the [Terraform website](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

2. **Configure AWS CLI**:
   - Install the AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials.

3. **Provision Infrastructure**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the Terraform configuration files.
   - Run `terraform init` to initialize the configuration.
   - Run `terraform apply` to provision the infrastructure.

## Application Deployment

1. **Deploy Front-end**:
   - SSH into the front-end EC2 instance.
   - Run the `deploy_frontend.sh` script.

2. **Deploy Back-end**:
   - SSH into the back-end EC2 instance.
   - Run the `deploy_backend.sh` script.

## CI/CD Pipeline Setup

1. **Create a CodePipeline**:
   - Use the AWS Management Console to create a new CodePipeline.
   - Configure the pipeline to use your source code repository.
   - Add build and deploy stages to automate the Terraform deployment process and application deployment.

## Storing Sensitive Information

1. **AWS Secrets Manager**:
   - Store sensitive information such as database passwords in AWS Secrets Manager.
   - Use the `aws_secretsmanager_secret` resource in Terraform to manage secrets.

## Best Practices

- Ensure security groups are configured to allow only necessary traffic.
- Regularly update and patch your EC2 instances.
- Monitor your infrastructure and applications for any issues.
